# gameboy cpu
when i tried making the intel 8080 it didn't work at all, gonna make the gameboy now instead as its has some elements from the intel 8080 and the z80
im not gonna code the entire gameboy emulator and instead gonna focus on other stuff, but i have tried my best to understand how everything sort of works.
